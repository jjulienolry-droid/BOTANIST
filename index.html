        Botanist celebrates harmony with nature in an environment that is as rich and diverse as the terroir it represents. 
        The experience reflects a new Pacific Northwest, one that has always been here, just waiting to be discovered. 
        This vibrant space features a collection of venues: a Dining Room, Cocktail Bar and Lab, Garden and TASCHEN Library, all inspired by the principles of botany.

            <h2>A Taste of the Pacific Northwest</h2>
            <p>
            Botanist offers a dining destination rich in experiences that reflect the vibrant,
            lush earthiness of the region, from design and décor to cocktails and cuisine. 
            The restaurant is located in one of the world’s most fertile, productive and diverse agricultural regions.
            The moderate climate of the Pacific Northwest ensures a year-round abundance of ingredients, which,
            in the hands of our culinary team and beverage masters, become the heart and soul of Botanist’s dining experience.
